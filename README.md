# Life
[Conway's Game of life]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)) written in Typescript with TDD and functional programming.

"index.ts" is a small demo which utilizes the main function 'getNextGen()'.
Besides index.ts, everything was written in short TDD cycles while utilizing functional programming paradigms.

The TDD cycles are reflected in the git log as almost each commit is either a Red, Green or Refactor step in a TDD cycle.
